					<p>The charioteer of Oenomaus. In the race for the hand of Hippodameia, the king’s daughter, he betrayed his master by removing a linch-pin.

				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Amphiaraus. Induced by his wife Eriphyle to join the expedition of Polyneices against Argos, he was swallowed up by an earthquake. His son (like Orestes) avenged his father and Amphiaraus was honoured as an earth-god. <a href="electra.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
